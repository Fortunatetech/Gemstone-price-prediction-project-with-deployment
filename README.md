# Project Setup

The `init_setup.sh` script automates the process of creating a virtual environment, activating it, and installing the necessary dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) must be installed and available in your PATH.
- The `requirements_dev.txt` file must be present in the same directory as `init_setup.sh`.

## Running the Setup Script

### Preferred Method: Make the Script Executable

1. **Make the script executable:**

   ```sh
   chmod +x init_setup.sh

2. **To run the script:**
  ```sh
  ./init_setup.sh


### Alternative Method: Run with Bash
- If you prefer not to change the file permissions, you can run the script directly with bash:

  ```sh
  bash init_setup.sh
